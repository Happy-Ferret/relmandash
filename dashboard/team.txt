Area Expert Advisors are people with particular expertise who have agreed to assist Mozilla with their area-specific expertise.  The Area Expert Advisors are different from peers. A peer is someone to whom the module owner has delegated some of her/his authority and a peer is expected to provide leadership for Mozilla within our specific context. Area Expert Advisors are advisors to Mozilla.  They may become peers, but they need not.

"peer." We're trying this based on the idea that anyone in the Desktop IT group
should be able to resolve problems and make fixes to the systems.)
