Things to do:
 ☐ check queries are valid before running - make sure if a query can't be run, it doesn't break the view of the individual user page
 ☐ don't pull the queries that don't resolve
 ☐ allow for selecting which queries to show on 'individual'/home page
 ☐ make 'views' be about selecting queries - do we really need product/component/user selection?
 ☐ timeout on queries running - reload tabs?
 ☐ need to add code to utils.py for pulling a per-query buglist and handing to macros (?? i forget what this is, might not be needed)

 Bug Fixes:
 ☐ table css is ugly - fix it

Round 2:
 ☐ implement actions properly
 ☐ run scripts against the db on a schedule
 ☐ make bug model not need manual update for version bumps
