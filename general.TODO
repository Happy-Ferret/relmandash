Things to do:
 ☐ get view of all a user's queries
 ☐ check queries are valid before running, don't pull the ones that don't work
 ☐ timeout on queries running
 ☐ put each query in its own tab
 ☐ allow for selecting only certain queries
 ☐ query should *not* be interpolated when creating/saving, only on pulling it out
 ☐ display the whole query
 ☐ need to add code to utils.py for pulling a per-query buglist and handing to macros
